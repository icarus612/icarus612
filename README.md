## I've decided to start over.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rebuilding my github to eliminate tech debt, so i can enjoy coding again.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcment learning with open AI gym.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any and everything.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm an open book.
- ðŸ“« Reach my at [my email](ellishogan95@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellis-hogan-99a646161/)

### I'm Going "All In" on the Mono-Repo Architecture 
#### TLDR;
Tech-debt sucks, so I'm moving all my smaller projects over to [my monorepo](https://www.github.com/icarus612/daedalus-mono), and cleaning out my old repos, so that I only have projects I plan on maintaining.
#### The Full Story
It started out as a struggle with finding a good naming convention for my projects, but grew into something larger: I've realize that I don't enjoy programming the way I've been doing it anymore, and I want to free myself from any stress and pressure I feel involving extracurricular coding. It is, after all, extracurricular. I want to minimize the code that I feel obligated to maintain, especially as I try to present myself as a quality coder. I just don't feel the need to go through my old repos and make them look up to par. So everything I have from up to this point is going into live in my monorepo. Inside that monorepo will be every small project I have and am working on. I will do my best ot keep it organized and README's up to date, but the point of the monorepo is to have a place to let myself go wild, and really let my creativity drive. 

The goal of all of this centers around these 3 things in particular:

1. It will take the weight off of repos, and github. I think the professional world places a lot of (sometimes overhyped) value in repos and github.
2. I will feel more comfortable starting new projects and trying/testing new things and ideas without really caring if they end up working or not.
3. It will help seperate the "hobbyist" and "professional" code in my repos, and make it clearer which projects I'm taking seriously verse the ones started on a whim.

I feel like I am entering a new phase of my software development journey, and I would like to make software that others want to use. Libraries that could actually be useful to other devs, while still having a free space to do whatever and not lose the work I care about.
