### Going "All In' on the Mono-Repo Architecture 
####TLDR;
Techdebt sucks, so I'm moving all my smaller projects over to [my monorepo](https://www.github.com/icarus612/daedalus-mono), and cleaning out my repos to only have projects I plan on maintaining.
####The Full Story
I've realize that I don't enjoy programming anymore.
